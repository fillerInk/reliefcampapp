# KeralaRescue.in Camps App 

A simple app for rescue camp coordinators to enter information about accomodated individuals and supply requirements. Data is synced to [keralarescue.in](https://keralarescue.in/relief_camps)

# Testing

### Local Server

- Setup the [backend Django application](https://github.com/IEEEKeralaSection/rescuekerala/) and run it.
- Make sure your mobile is connected to same WiFi as your computer, and find out your local IP. (Example: 192.168.0.20)
- Import this project to Android studio.
- Edit API base URL (with your local IP and server port) in `app/src/main/java/xyz/appmaker/keralarescue/Tools/Config.java`.
   
   Example:
   ```java
   public class Config {
      public static String BASE_URL = "http://192.168.0.20:8000";
   }
   ```

- Create a user for the backend (using `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`). Create a relief camp.

### Using Test Server
We have hosted a test server of the Django application at [http://35.202.24.11/](http://35.202.24.11/find_people/). 
This can be used for testing the app from the pre-built apk [Link to APK in repo](https://github.com/Appmaker-xyz/KeralaRescueRefugeeDB/raw/master/app-debug.apk).
You can use the default username:password (admin:admin) combination for the app for testing. 

### App Testings Steps

- Run the app. Login using username and password for the user (admin:admin for test server settings).
